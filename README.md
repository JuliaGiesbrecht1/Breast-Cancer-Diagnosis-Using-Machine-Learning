# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-Using-Machine-Learning

My focus for this project is on breast cancer diagnosis using machine learning. I will use the breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) data set https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

This public dataset of breast cancer patients categorized tumors as either malignant or benign. It identifies features from a digitized image of a breast mass's fine needle aspirate (FNA). The attributes describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

My goal is to answer the following business question:
How can machine learning improve breast cancer diagnosis accuracy and therefore reduce healthcare costs? (Reduce unnecessary treatments or time spent with each patient, improve workflow, etc.)
